    <h3>What is Sport Climbing</h3>
    <p>Sport climbing is a form of  climbing that involves ascending climbing routes, called "routes" or "lines," with <strong>pre-fixed protection </strong> &#40;including anchors, bolts&#41;, and the use of safety equipment, including ropes, harnesses, and quickdraws.</p>

    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Shoes</li>
        <li>Personal Harness</li>
        <li>Ropes</li>
        <li>Belay Devices</li>
        <li>Quickdraws</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>How to Start</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Pre-requisites:</strong> Do you know how to lead climb? Lead belay? Because greater heights are involved, risk is magnified. You should be an experienced lead climber & belayer to climb independently. Otherwise, get a guide!</li>
        <li><strong>Plan a trip:</strong> For independent climbers only - Decide on a crag to visit and some friends to go with. Remember to check the weather.</li>
        <li><strong>Getting there:</strong> Get to area, hike a little if required, find the crag and your route</li>
        <li><strong>Gear up:</strong> Get your equipment sorted out</li>
        <li><strong>Climb!</strong></li>
    </ol>
