    <h3>What is Bouldering</h3>
    <p>Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that involves climbing short, yet challenging routes, called "problems," on artificial indoor climbing walls or natural rock formations without the use of ropes or harnesses. Instead of climbing to great heights, bouldering typically involves climbing routes that are only a few meters high, and climbers use crash pads to protect themselves in case of falls.</p>
